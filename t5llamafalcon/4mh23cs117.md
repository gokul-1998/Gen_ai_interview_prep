## 🔵 T5 — Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer

**Creator:** Google Research (2019)

T5 treats **every NLP task as a text-to-text problem**. Whether it's translation, summarization, or classification — all tasks are framed as: `input text → output text`.

### 📍 Where Is It Used?
- Text summarization
- Language translation
- Question answering
- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots and NLP pipelines

### ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Unified framework for all NLP tasks | Computationally heavy |
| Highly versatile | Requires large memory |
| Strong benchmark performance | Not ideal for real-time apps |

### 📊 Accuracy
Achieved state-of-the-art on **GLUE** and **SuperGLUE** benchmarks. ~91%+ on many classification tasks.

### 🏗️ Architecture
```
Input Text → [Encoder] → Context Representation → [Decoder] → Output Text
Task Prefix: "summarize: ...", "translate English to French: ..."
```

## 🟠 LLaMA — Large Language Model Meta AI

**Creator:** Meta AI (2023), available as LLaMA 1, 2, and 3

LLaMA is Meta's **open-source LLM** designed to be efficient and accessible — delivering GPT-level performance at smaller scales.

### 📍 Where Is It Used?
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Code generation
- Research and fine-tuning
- Domain-specific AI apps (medical, legal, etc.)

### ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Open-source and free to use | Needs powerful GPU to run locally |
| Highly fine-tunable | Can hallucinate facts |
| Efficient — strong performance per parameter | Smaller variants are less capable |

### 📊 Accuracy
LLaMA 3 (70B) scores ~**85%+ on MMLU** — competitive with GPT-4 on many benchmarks.

### 🔄 Version Differences
```
LLaMA 1 → Research-only release, 7B–65B params
LLaMA 2 → Open for commercial use, improved safety
LLaMA 3 → Better reasoning, longer context, stronger benchmarks
```

## 🟢 Falcon — Fast and Lightweight LLM

**Creator:** Technology Innovation Institute (TII), UAE (2023)

Falcon is a high-performance **open-source LLM** built for efficiency. Falcon-40B was the top open-source model on Hugging Face's Open LLM Leaderboard when released.

### 📍 Where Is It Used?
- Text generation
- Summarization
- Enterprise AI applications
- Research and production deployments

### ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Top open-source benchmark performance | Smaller community vs LLaMA |
| Apache 2.0 license (commercial use OK) | Limited multilingual support |
| Fast inference | Fewer fine-tuned variants available |

### 📊 Accuracy
- Falcon-40B: ~**79% on MMLU**
- Falcon-180B: Rivals GPT-3.5 on multiple benchmarks

## 🎯 15 Basic Interview Questions

### T5 Questions

**1. What does T5 stand for, and what makes it unique?**
> T5 = Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer. It converts every NLP task into a text-in, text-out format using a single unified model.

**2. What is the "text-to-text" framework in T5?**
> Instead of separate models per task, T5 uses one model with task prefixes like `"summarize: ..."` or `"translate English to French: ..."`.

**3. What dataset was T5 pre-trained on?**
> The **C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus)** dataset — a massive cleaned web text dataset.

**4. Name two tasks T5 can perform.**
> Translation and summarization. It can also do Q&A, sentiment analysis, and more.

**5. What architecture does T5 use?**
> **Encoder-Decoder Transformer** architecture — encoder processes input, decoder generates output.

### LLaMA Questions

**6. What is LLaMA and who created it?**
> LLaMA is Meta's open-source large language model family, designed for research and commercial use with efficient performance.

**7. Why is LLaMA popular among researchers?**
> It's open-source, highly customizable, and delivers strong performance even at smaller parameter sizes.

**8. What is fine-tuning and why is it used with LLaMA?**
> Fine-tuning adapts LLaMA on domain-specific data (medical, legal, etc.) without training from scratch, saving cost and time.

**9. What is the difference between LLaMA 1, 2, and 3?**
> Each version improved performance, context window length, and safety alignment. LLaMA 3 is the most capable and aligned version.

**10. What does "hallucination" mean in LLMs like LLaMA?**
> When the model confidently generates incorrect or made-up information — a common challenge in all LLMs.

### Falcon Questions

**11. What is Falcon and who built it?**
> Falcon is an open-source LLM by the **Technology Innovation Institute (TII)** in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

**12. What makes Falcon stand out from other open-source models?**
> It was the first open-source model to top the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard, with a fully commercial Apache 2.0 license.

**13. What is MMLU and how does Falcon perform on it?**
> MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is a standard LLM benchmark. Falcon-40B scores ~79%, and Falcon-180B rivals GPT-3.5.

**14. What license does Falcon use?**
> **Apache 2.0** — completely free for both research and commercial use.

**15. Compare Falcon and LLaMA in one sentence.**
> Both are open-source LLMs, but LLaMA has a larger community and more fine-tuned variants, while Falcon was built for raw performance and commercial accessibility.
